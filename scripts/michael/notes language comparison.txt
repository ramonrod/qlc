Measurements for Morphosyntactic Language Comparison

Central problem of languages comparison:
Different languages cannot be compared without some kind of normalisation across languages to make them comparable.

This normalisation is measurement. Kinds of measurement: Classification ("C"), Count (element of ℕ), Continuous Value (element of ℝ). Measurement is a function on (sets of) Language-Specific Expressions.

A Language-Specific Expression (e) occurs in a Contextual Situation (s). The basic entity for language comparison are contextually-situated language-specific expressions. (often: Contextually-Situated Meaning/Function)

[note: contextual situations only apply for morphosyntax. phonology needs something different. basing on phonetics? phoneme distinction because of meaning distinction!]



A single contextual situation (s) can be very specific, or more general. Definition of s has to be language-independent.

Monadic comparative parameters (M): M:E→c

A comparison between two languages L_A and L_B consists of a measurement of sets of Language-Specific Expressions E_A={e_A} and E_B={e_B} occurring in a suitably chosen Contextual Situation s.

Relational comparative parameters (R): R(E,E)→

Given two contextual situations s_i and s_j, define a measurement based on a comparison *within a single language* between E_s_i and E_s_j.

Practical problems: choosing expressions & defining of a comparative measurement on sets of expressions. 

Comparative measurement consists of various parts: 
- mapping function between S_A and S_B ("which should be compared with which")
- language-specific measurements on sets (typically pairs) of expressions from the same language (working on more than one S)
- comparative measurement on expressions that can be applied across languages. (working on a single S)




Simple situation: parallel data; More complex (and more general): indirectly linked data.

Parallel data: choose a set of Contextual Situations (S) and collect parallel Language-Specific Expressions (E) across languages. This gives a clearly defined strategy for selecting expressions and an inherent mapping function between S_A and S_B.

Language comparison: choose a set S={s_i} of contextual situation(s), and collection expressions E={e_i} occuring in this context
