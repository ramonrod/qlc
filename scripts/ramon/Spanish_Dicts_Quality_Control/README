README

The code sp_dict_for_comparison.py loads many different spanish word lists as the 1-grams files from the google project "Books-Ngram-Viewer". The files from the google project have not been added hier because they are very large (they are in total 9 files for the spanish 1-grams, each around 350 Mbs). 

The idea is to compare the words collected from different spanish sources with the translations from the QLC-Project. All entries will be decoded in utf-8 und decomposed (NFD) and normalized. The script will loop through all the spanish sources and comprare them with the translations. Those translations which don't match in the sources will be given as a result.


to run the script type:

python sp_dict_for_comparison.py Yourfile (i.e. translations_thiesen1998_25_339.txt)

or 

python sp_dict_for_comparison.py Yourfile > results (i.e. if you want to save the results in the file "results.txt")

Note: the file Nr.8 from the GoogleNgrams is omitted in the script. It is not relevant for the comparison, and you can save some time :)!

Don't forget to change your path if needed!
