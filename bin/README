README bin/
-----------

* The bin/ directory contains scripts that use the qlc libary.

There is a symbolic data/ directory that points to the qlc data directory: ../src/qlc/data
It can be used when a script requires an argument "data_path", e.g. counterparts_huber1992.py data_path.

* The bin/example_scripts/ directory contains sample scripts of how to use the qlc library.

* The bin/translation_graph/ directory contains scripts that work with translation graphs.

* The bin/ipynb/ directory contains iPython notebooks.

Enjoy!
