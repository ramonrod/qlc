"""
Ngram reader for graphemes of the project Quantitative Language Comparison.

The orthography.OrthographyParser class returns a tuple of parsed graphemes. 
The functions in this class take a tuple of graphemes as a parameter and parse 
those into various ngram formats, returning

def ngrams_from_graphemes(graphemes, n=1):
    """
    Takes a tuple of (orthographically parsed) graphemes and returns a tuple of ngrams.

    Default is 1 ngram, i.e. methods will return a tuple of unigrams.

    Note: a word in a dataset should never have less than three elements, 
    e.g. if a word is composed of only one sound (represented by one grapheme, 
    then with the word boundaries ("#"), the length of the word should 
    be at least 3: "#u#". Therefore a tuple of length three will be returned: 
    ("#", "u", "#"). This script will fail if the input tuple is length less 
    than 3.

    Note also that one element tuples (as casted from a list) contain a comma, e.g.:
    >>> l = ["1"]
    >>> print tuple(l)
    ('1',)
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    graphemes: tuple of strings
        a tuple from which the tuple of ngrams is extracted
    n: integer
        the number of graphemes that have to be looked at for the ngram
        default: n = 1 (unigram mode)
        
    Returns

    a tuple of tupled ngrams for the input string
